The functions c_c_c through cs2_cb compute the lengths of the RS curves, for
a certain increment of configuration (x,y,phi) computed in the function
reed-shepp.

The function reed-shepp computes the increment between two configurations and
scans all RS curves to determine the shortest one. It is called through the
function min_length_rs to avoid a too small increment (which could yield
numerical errors).

The function constRS computes the discretized path (in pathx, pathy,
and patht) of the RS curve number NUM, parameters t, u and v, starting
at (x1,y1,t1).  It calls fct_curve that computes the path for a right
circular arc, left circular atc, and straight line. The discretization
done in fct-curve is rather ugly, and you could rewrite this function.

Jean-Claude,

Two questions about the RS code:

1. I assume the #import "RobotView.h" can be deleted?
2. What is the significance of the following parameters
   to reed_shepp():

   double *tr,*ur,*vr;
   int *numero;


Thanks,

ANSWER:

1. You are right. You need it only for the RADCURV parameter family
(see next message). But it is preferable to redefine these parameters
in your own program, to avoid importing a long file, that is mostly
irrelevant to your program.

2. From the brief description of the RS curves given in HO 9 you can
gather that RS curves consist of 3 to 5 segments (straight segments
and/or circular arcs). However, at most 3 have unpredetermined
lengths.  The parameters tr, ur, vr are intended to contain these
lengths.  For example, the first call in the function reed_shepp() is
to c_c_c(). The pointers to tn, un, and vn are passed to c_c_c(),
which computes the length of the 3 circular arcs of this RS curve. At
the end, reed_shepp puts in tr, ur, and vr the parameters
corresponding to the shortest RS curves found.  The unit of length for
a straight segment is whatever you want.  For a circular arc it is in
radians.

The parameter numero is just the number identifying a RS curve.  The
value given at the end of reed-shepp is the number (1 to 48)
identifying the shortes RS curve found between the two given
configurations.

What are the units of

   extern float RADCURV,RADCURVMUL2,RADCURVMUL4;
   extern float SQRADCURV,SQRADCURVMUL2;

and where should they be defined?  Also, should
SQRADCURVMUL2 contain 

RADCURV*RADCURV*2 

or

RADCURVMUL2*RADCURVMUL2?

Thanks,
--james


ANSWER:

RADCURV is the radius of the circular arcs in the RS curves (the
turning radius of the robot). It is in whatever units you want.

RADCURVMUL2 is defined as 2 * RADCURV
RADCURVMUL4 is defined as 4 * RADCURV
SQRADCURV   is defined as RADCURV * RADCURV
SQRADCURVMUL2 is defined as 4 * RADCURV * RADCURV

They are defined in RobotView.h, but rather than importing this long
file, you can just redefine them here.







I hope this answers your questions. Thanks for raising them, since the
other students are likely to have the same difficulties as you.
